# GuardianKnight
For Ludum Dare 43 

Theme: Sacrifices must be made

Idea: Player controls a Knight that must protect his ally/loved one/etc, 
but enemies are too strong and to acomplish his duty he could only overdrive his abilities obtaining teporarily greater strength,
but lowering it afterwards

Example: Overdriven movement ability allows player to fly, but afterwards even jumps wont be easy
